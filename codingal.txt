New studies show that it is possible to detect that someone is at risk of faster cognitive decline once they grow old by looking at the signs they show during their childhood around the age of 11.
 However, the good news is that we can still improve our cognitive abilities if we lead a healthier lifestyle, particularly exercising more often, meditating on a regular basis, avoiding smoking, and eating less foods that are high in cholesterol and are bad for the heart.
  Moreover, speaking another language other than your native language and playing instruments can also have a positive influence, slowing down the brain's aging process. 

While some decline in our brain functions is to be expected as we grow older, we should pay close attention to the signs our bodies give us, even in our younger years. 
Some of these signs can indeed be related to other health issues, but it's important not to rule out premature aging of our brain.
